# My personal dotfiles for different devices

# Chuwi Hi10 Max - Hyprland
These are the dotfiles for my Chuwi Hi10 Max running Arch Linux with both Gnome and Hyprland installed. <br>
The Hyprland dotfiles are for when the tablet is connected to a keyboard, and Gnome (no dotfiles) is for when I am in tablet mode (I mention it due to using some Gnome dependencies). <br>
Please note, these hyprland dotfiles are NOT fancy, I use my computer to actually do work. I would still be using i3 on X11 if wayland wasn't (unfortunaly) more functional for me.
